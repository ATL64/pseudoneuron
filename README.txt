PseudoNeuron is a website that ranks pseudosciences.  We use a score that basically measures how “dumb yet interesting” the pseudoscience is.
We proposed a new pseudoscience called “hydropathic water”, which is basically magical water that enhances your critical thinking.  Project is currently abandoned, but it was a nice exploration of the concept of epistemological spam.
